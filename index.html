<div>
	<h2>Hi, I'm Benoit Dehapiot</h2>
	<p align="justify"> I am a biologist by training with a solid experience 
    in image processing and	data analysis. During my career, I notably studied 
    how actin filaments dynamics could influence larger scale processes in various
    in vivo and in vitro models. My research has allowed me to develop a keen 
    interest in	quantifying complex processes through microscopy image analysis. 
    This encouraged me to join and help setting up a multi-disciplinary platform that
    supports researchers and students from the 
	<a href="https://centuri-livingsystems.org"> CENTURI scientific community </a> . </p>
