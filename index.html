	<h3>Hello, I'm Benoit Dehapiot</h3>

        I am a biologist by training with a solid experience 
        in image processing and	data analysis. During my career, I notably studied 
        how actin filaments dynamics could influence larger scale processes in various
        in vivo and in vitro models. My research has allowed me to develop a keen 
        interest in	quantifying complex processes through microscopy image analysis. 
        This encouraged me to join and help setting up a multi-disciplinary platform that
        supports researchers and students from the 
        <a href="https://centuri-livingsystems.org"> CENTURI scientific community </a> .
