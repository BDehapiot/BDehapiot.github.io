                I am a biologist by training with a solid experience in image processing and data analysis. 
                During my career, I notably studied how actin filaments dynamics could influence larger 
                scale processes in various in vivo and in vitro models. My research has allowed me to develop
                a keen interest in quantifying complex processes through microscopy image analysis. 
                This encouraged me to join and help setting up a multi-disciplinary platform that
                supports researchers and students from the
