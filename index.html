                I am a biologist by training with a solid experience 
                in image processing and	data analysis. During my career, I notably studied 
                how actin filaments dynamics could influence larger scale processes in various
                in vivo and in vitro models. My research has allowed me to develop a keen 
                interest in	quantifying complex processes through microscopy image analysis. 
                This encouraged me to join and help setting up a multi-disciplinary platform that
                supports researchers and students from the 
                <a href="https://centuri-livingsystems.org">CENTURI scientific community</a> .
